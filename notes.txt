To be able to run all files using Pytest the name of the files should start with test_
To run all of them we should use Terminal
just type the command pytest

If we want to see the print statements during the run we should use the command pytest -s
To run one separate file from the terminal we can type:  pytest and then the name of the specific file we wanna run
Example: pytest test_2PyTestValidation.py

To run from terminal the only one specific function we have to provide the function name in addition to file name
Example: pytest test_2PyTestValidation.py::test_thirdCheck

We can also tag tests in pytest into groops (like Smoke test) with syntax @pytest.mark.smoke
Example: put the tag @pytest.mark.smoke for the tests  and then use the command pytest -m smoke - in this case all sest with tag smoke will run

@pytest.mark.skip will skip this test from running

Fixture (precondition) linckage should be provided as an argument in the test

Fixtures are able to return value
Value from the fixtures can be checked by assertions with the word assert
Example:  assert preWork == "pass"

We can chain different preconditions (fixtures)
Example:  def test_initialCheck(preWork, secondWork):

yield   this statement in fixture will separate what to execute before test and after
Basically the code will execute the precondition up to the yield
And then return to the remaining part after the test is done. Just like @AfterTest
